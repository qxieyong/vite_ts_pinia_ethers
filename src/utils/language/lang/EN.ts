        tips2: 'Light your torch',
        describe: `<p>In a mysterious and ancient country, a traditional event is about to begin - the Olympic Torch relay.</p>
        <p>The Torch Bearer stands at the ancient altar, holding a torch, and ignites the flame with a solar lens.</p>
        <p>Once the flame is ignited, the members of the Torch Guard take over the torch. They bear the responsibility of protecting the sacred purity of the flame.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Torch Guard brings the flame to the capital of Greece, Athens. The torch will be passed on to a special group of individualsâ€”the Greek torchbearers. These torchbearers come from various fields and showcase the brilliance of the sacred flame to the people.</p>
        <p>In the end, the torchbearers will bring the flame to the main cauldron. Waiting there is the Torch Igniter, who will light the main cauldron in a solemn ceremony. This symbolizes that the Olympic flame, representing peace, unity, and friendship, will never be extinguished...</p>`
